Good naming can make a huge difference in program readability.
1. Be clear and not ambiguous.
2. Keep consistent.
3. Naming conventions can be broken into three broad cateogries: c-style, camelCase and CamelCase.
4. Use prefix or suffix if needed. Usally, g_ for global, s_ for static, p_ for point.
5. Avoid abbreviations as possible. But use it if it's too long to read.
